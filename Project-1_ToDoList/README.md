# To-Do List Application

This is a simple command-line To-Do List application written in python. The app allows users to manage tasks, including adding new tasks, viewing existing ones, and removing completed tasks. It creates a text file 'todo_list.txt' to store tasks persistently. Each task has a unique identifier (UUID), a task description and a deadline.
